    <h6>As the economy continues to recover from the 2008 recession, homelessness continues to be an issue. Although the Nebraska homelessness average is down about 3% statewide as you can see in the chart below, Lincoln's homeless problem is only increasing. </h6>

<h6>Lincoln's homeless population has steadily risen. A study done by the Lincoln Homeless Coalition shows that 53% of Lincoln homeless live in transitional housing, 36% live in emergency shelter, and the remaining 11% live completely unsheltered.
The below charts were created to illustrate the afformentiioned study, they only show the number of <i>sheltered</i> homeless people.</h6>

<p> It's hard to say if the decline in Lincoln's unemployment rate (which was 2.1% as of April 2015) will help see a change in the number of homeless. Luckily Lincoln, Nebraska has quite a few resources that are very accessible for those who are in need.</p>
